This study investigates the potential of predicting the stock market using machine learning, with a particular emphasis on the role of sentiment analysis in improving prediction accuracy. By extracting public sentiment from large platforms such as X, the research aims to assess its influence on stock market trends, positing that incorporating sentiment scores could enhance predictive accuracy. The research focuses on Paytm, a prominent Indian company, due to its significant market presence. Sentiment analysis tools, including TextBlob and VADER, were utilized, and their effectiveness was evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficients. Additionally, other correlation coefficients such as Spearman and Kendall were employed to determine the relationship between sentiment scores and Paytm's stock price components (OPEN, HIGH, and LOW). Furthermore, a Random Forest Regressor was implemented both with and without sentiment scores to illustrate their impact on stock price prediction.
